This repository is literally a straight copy from the awesome [Zell Liew's dotfiles](https://github.com/zellwk/dotfiles) repository (Also, please check out his work and materials he's brillant at breaking down complex stuffs in simple terms. I learned so many things from his blog. Check it out [here](https://zellwk.com/blog/) and don't forget to [follow him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/zellwk))

I only deleted Windows installation and some other minor instructions.

## Run `./setup.sh`

What this does:

1. Installs Homebrew
2. Installs binaries and apps with Homebrew (see [brew.sh](mac/brew.sh) for a list of installed items)
3. Sets npm permissions
4. Installs npm clis (see [npm.sh](shared/npm.sh) for a list of installed clis)
5. Create symlinks for dotfiles
6. Sets several defaults for MacOS

## Run ./zsh-install.sh

What this does:

1. Installs ZSH
2. Installs Oh my ZSH
3. Installs Oh my ZSH plugins

Open a new shell too see the changes.
